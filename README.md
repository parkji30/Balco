<h1> Motivation </h1>

Balloon-borne telescopes have grown tremendously in their capabilities for capturing high quality science
data. However, there is a challenge associated with these advancements: the limited down-link bandwidth
available to most balloon payloads to transmit science data. 

Progress in astronomical research
demonstrates that the compression of crucial data is becoming increasingly important. Such a clear
example lies in the balloon-borne telescopes BLAST-TNG and SuperBIT. Being able to down-link science
data during the flight is crucial to evaluate payload performance, and debug any inevitable problems. 

The use of compression algorithms proves to be an effective solution in increasing the rate at which data can
be down-linked, while ensuring the down-linked data have sufficient quality for science analysis.

<h1> Balco </h1> 
Balco is an efficient compression optimizer software that will find the most optimal compression factor to image quality ratio for a given image.
<br>
So far, Balco is able to compress JPEGS, PNGS, and FITS images.
